# What is Power Platform and why would you care? 

Before we get our hand dirty with building some cool stuff with Power Platform and Azure Functions, let's first understand, what Power Platform is and how you could benefit from it. 

Power Platform is Microsoft's Low Code business applications Platform. It consists of four different applications: 

* Power BI to unify data from many sources to create interactive, immersive dashboards and reports that provide actionable insights and drive business results
* Power Apps to rapidly prototype and build apps that easily connect to data and run on any device
* Power Automate to include powerful workflow automation directly in your apps or for standalone processing of repetetive tasks 
* Power Virtual Agents to easily create and maintain intelligent chatbots

On the data lavel, we will find 
* Connectors
  * hundreds of built-in connectors to online-services
  * an on-premises data gateway to connect to legacy applications that are not hosted in a cloud
  * the ability to create custom connectors that link to services that aren't covered yet, or that you like to modify and share across your organization
* Dataverse, which provides a secure relational cloud-based storage option for your data - with rich data types & enterprise-grade governance
* AI Builder - which can enhance apps and flows with AI

This should do as an overview. In the upcoming Azure Functions University Challenges we want you to extend solutions wwith low code approach. Objectives of these exercises are:

* gain basic knowledge on Power Automate to process a workload
* gain basic knowledge on Power Apps on how to build a UI and a custom connector for an Azure Function
* know when to use and not to use low code (limitations, scope)
